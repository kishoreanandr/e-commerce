# Milestone 5: Create Departments API

## Overview
This milestone implements REST API endpoints for departments to support department-based navigation and filtering. The implementation includes proper database queries with JOIN operations and comprehensive error handling.

## ✅ **Completed Requirements**

### 1. Required API Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/departments` - List all departments with product count
- ✅ `GET /api/departments/{id}` - Get specific department details
- ✅ `GET /api/departments/{id}/products` - Get all products in a department

### 2. Implementation Details
- ✅ Added departments endpoints to existing API server
- ✅ Implemented proper database queries with JOIN operations
- ✅ Included product count for each department in the departments list
- ✅ Handled error cases (department not found, no products in department, etc.)
- ✅ Tested all endpoints thoroughly

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### New DTOs Created
1. **DepartmentWithProductCountDTO**: Represents departments with product count
   ```java
   {
     "id": 2,
     "name": "Women",
     "description": "Women's clothing and accessories",
     "productCount": 150
   }
   ```

### New Repository Methods
1. **findAllDepartmentsWithProductCount()**: Uses JOIN to get departments with product counts
2. **findDepartmentWithProductCountById()**: Gets specific department with product count

### New Service Methods
1. **getAllDepartmentsWithProductCount()**: Returns departments with product counts
2. **getDepartmentWithProductCountById()**: Returns specific department with product count
3. **getProductsByDepartmentId()**: Returns paginated products for a department

### New Controller Endpoints
1. **GET /api/departments**: Returns departments with product counts
2. **GET /api/departments/{id}**: Returns specific department details
3. **GET /api/departments/{id}/products**: Returns products for a department

## 📊 **Database Queries**

### JOIN Operations Used
1. **Department List with Product Count**:
   ```sql
   SELECT d, COUNT(p.id) as productCount 
   FROM Department d 
   LEFT JOIN d.products p 
   GROUP BY d.id, d.name, d.description
   ```

2. **Department Products**:
   ```sql
   SELECT p FROM Product p 
   WHERE p.department.id = :departmentId
   ```

## 🧪 **Testing Commands**

### Test Department Endpoints
```bash
# Get all departments with product count
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/departments"

# Get department by ID
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/departments/2"

# Get department by name
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/departments/name/Women"

# Get products by department ID
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/departments/2/products?page=0&size=5"
```

### Expected Response Formats

      "productCount": 25
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Women",
      "description": "Women's clothing and accessories",
      "productCount": 150
    }
  ]
}
```

      "department": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Women",
        "description": null
      },
      "sku": "C4CA4238A0B923820DCC509A6F75849B",
      "distributionCenterId": 1
    }
  ],
  "totalElements": 150,
  "totalPages": 8,
  "currentPage": 0
}
```
